 Tips for getting started:

 1. Use Claude to help with file analysis, editing, bash commands and git
 2. Be as specific as you would with another engineer for the best results
 3. ✔ Run /init to create a CLAUDE.md file with instructions for Claude

   micro tasks you break down that is linear add difficulty for me. Now please break down all the Chapter 9 tasks 
  in PROGRESS.md to the MICRO_TASKS4.md (create this file if not exists)，follow the [micro_tasks_template.txt]

  ⎿  ☒ Read PROGRESS.md Chapter 9 structure                              
     ☐ Study existing micro-task template format from MICRO_TASKS.md
     ☐ Create MICRO_TASKS4.md with Chapter 9 breakdown
     ☐ Break down Chapter 9 into progressive micro-tasks (primary→senior)
     ☐ Add summary and learning prompt to end of chapter
     ☐ Update CLAUDE.md with Chapter 9 instructions
