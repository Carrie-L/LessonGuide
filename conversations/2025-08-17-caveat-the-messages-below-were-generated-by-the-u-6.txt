> Great, My level is primary android developer, but my goal is a senior android developer, so please make sure 
  the  micro tasks you break down that is linear add difficulty for me. Now please break down all the Chapter 
  12 tasks in PROGRESS.md to the MICRO_TASKS_C12.md (create this file if not exists)，follow the 
  [micro_tasks_template.txt] ，once you finished all tasks, please give me a short summarize no more than 300 
  words about what you've done and add the prompt about these to the end of the chapter. Finally, add these 
  instruments to the CLAUDE.md so that we can resume tasks next time we start a new session. Must contain a 
  progress track.

  📋 Summary (300 words max)

  I've successfully broken down Chapter 12 (网络与系统 - 基础设施知识) into 68 comprehensive micro-tasks
  following the ADHD-friendly learning template.

  Key Accomplishments:

  📚 Structured Learning Path: Created 4 major sections covering HTTP protocols, TCP/IP networking, operating
  system concepts, and concurrent programming - each with 17 precisely-timed 5-minute tasks progressing from
  primary to senior level understanding.

  🎯 Progressive Difficulty: Tasks advance from basic concepts → practical implementation → advanced design →
  interview preparation, ensuring linear skill development for your primary→senior transition.

  💡 Practical Focus: Every theoretical concept includes hands-on coding exercises, real Android
  implementations, and performance testing, making abstract concepts tangible and applicable.

  🔄 Mobile-Centric Approach: All tasks consider mobile device constraints, network conditions, and
  Android-specific optimizations, ensuring relevance to your career goals.

  📈 Comprehensive Coverage:
  - HTTP Evolution (85 min): From HTTP/1.0 to HTTP/3, caching strategies, HTTPS security
  - Network Programming (85 min): TCP/UDP protocols, mobile network adaptation, long connection management
  - OS Fundamentals (85 min): Process/thread management, memory models, Android system optimization
  - Concurrent Programming (85 min): Lock mechanisms, atomic operations, high-concurrency system design

  🎯 Learning Methodology: Each task includes specific learning objectives, actionable steps, checkpoint
  questions for verification, and output files for progress tracking. The structure maintains your
  ADHD-friendly 5-minute focus blocks while building deep senior-level expertise.

  📊 Progress Tracking: Comprehensive checkbox system allows you to monitor completion across all 68 tasks,
  with estimated completion times and clear learning milestones.

  This foundation establishes the systems-level thinking essential for senior Android architects who need to
  make informed decisions about performance, scalability, and technical trade-offs.

  📚 Task 1.1.1: JMM概念入门 (5分钟) ⏰

  Let's start with the foundation! The Java Memory Model (JMM) is crucial for understanding how multithreading
  works in Android.

  🎯 学习目标

  理解什么是Java内存模型，以及为什么它对Android开发很重要

  📖 核心概念讲解

  Java内存模型(JMM)的本质：
  - 主内存(Main Memory): 所有线程共享的内存区域，存储所有变量的"真实值"
  - 工作内存(Working Memory): 每个线程私有的内存区域，存储主内存中变量的副本
  - 问题: 线程A修改了工作内存中的变量，线程B不一定能立即看到这个修改

  想象一下：
  主内存 (共享)
     ↕️
  工作内存A (线程A私有) ← → 工作内存B (线程B私有)

  ✅ 检查点问题

  能用自己的话解释：为什么多线程程序会有"可见性"问题？

  📝 你的任务

  请在 student_progress/ 目录创建 jmm_notes.md 文件，写下你对JMM的理解。

  提示: 可以用生活中的例子来类比，比如"两个人分别在自己房间里工作，需要通过客厅的公告板来交换信息"。

  准备好了吗？要开始这个任务吗？ 💪
